# unstandard

The unstandard library has what the standard library (& Foundation) craves.


## Disclaimer

**`unstandard` is full of hacks that can break your code after an SDK update.**

This is entirely due to the preference of using non-namespaced methods
extending types not owned by this library, even though doing so is 
frowned upon in public & open-source software packages.

If it's of any assurance to you I use this library in every iOS, macOS, & Linux 
project I write. I am a regular day-one user of SDK beta software, 
so namespace collisions should be fixed quickly.

The code is MIT-licensed, so feel free to use it as you see fit.

Pull requests are appriciated!
