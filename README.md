# unstandard

The unstandard library has what the standard library (& Foundation) craves.


## Disclaimer

**`unstandard` is full of hacks that can break your code after an SDK update.**

Not hacks as in "sneaky tricks that are going to bankrupt you & punish your users", 
but hacks as in, showing little respect to rules of convention such as 
using non-namespaced methods extending types not owned by this library.

If it's of any assurance to you I use this library in every project I write. 
I am a regular day-one user of SDK beta software, so namespace collisions
should be fixed quickly.

The code is MIT-licensed, so feel free to use it as you see fit.

Pull requests are appreciated!
